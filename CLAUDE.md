# Claude Code Instructions

## CRITICAL DATA SOURCE RULES

**NEVER use Urban Institute API, NCES CCD, or ANY federal data source**
— the entire point of these packages is to provide STATE-LEVEL data
directly from state DOEs. Federal sources aggregate/transform data
differently and lose state-specific details. If a state DOE source is
broken, FIX IT or find an alternative STATE source — do not fall back to
federal data.

## Git Commits and PRs

- NEVER reference Claude, Claude Code, or AI assistance in commit
  messages
- NEVER reference Claude, Claude Code, or AI assistance in PR
  descriptions
- NEVER add Co-Authored-By lines mentioning Claude or Anthropic
- Keep commit messages focused on what changed, not how it was written

## LIVE Pipeline Testing

This package includes `tests/testthat/test-pipeline-live.R` with LIVE
network tests.

### Test Categories:

1.  URL Availability - HTTP 200 checks
2.  File Download - Verify actual file (not HTML error)
3.  File Parsing - readxl/readr succeeds
4.  Column Structure - Expected columns exist
5.  get_raw_enr() - Raw data function works
6.  Data Quality - No Inf/NaN, non-negative counts
7.  Aggregation - State total \> 0
8.  Output Fidelity - tidy=TRUE matches raw

### Running Tests:

``` r
devtools::test(filter = "pipeline-live")
```

See `state-schooldata/CLAUDE.md` for complete testing framework
documentation.
